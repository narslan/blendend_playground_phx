# BlendendPlaygroundPhx

A web UI for experimenting with [`blendend`](https://github.com/narslan/blendend): 
Safety: the backend evaluates the code you type. Run it only on a trusted machine.

## Features
- **Playground** – live sketchbook for `blendend` snippets. 
- **Swatches** – palette browser rendered as collages. It shows how colors interact on a composition.

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
